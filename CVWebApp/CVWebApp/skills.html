    <h3>Abilities</h3>

    <p>Time Management</p>
    <p>
        During my time at university there were many times I
        worked towards strict deadlines, the most relevant of
        these would be my final year project, which involved me
        completing multiple pieces of work to form the overall
        project, from posters to a large final report. This
        required me to accurately map out my time and resources
        to meet the varied requirements of each section, I did
        this using timetable and Gantt charts to properly
        allocate time for each piece of the project, and to
        prepare for cases of needing more or less time. Because
        of this preparation I was able to complete each piece of
        the project on time to a high quality, and in cases
        where more time was needed than initially expected,
        because of my preparation I had no need to reschedule,
        as I was prepared for the eventuality.

    <p>Communication</p>
    <p>
        A notable module I chose to undertake in my final year
        of university was Large-Scale Software Engineering,
        during this module our small team were given a scenario
        and asked to complete the full pre-implementation phases
        for this product. This involved regular team discussions
        to equally divide work and identify strengths and
        weaknesses in the group to help maintain an efficient
        workflow and provide support to any team members that
        were struggling with a particular task using clear,
        concise communication, especially as some members of the
        team were foreign students. The team communicated with
        multiple in person meetings every week, as well as a
        weekly scheduled Teams meeting where members could
        compare work and voice any problems they were having.
        Because of the groups constant communication and
        distribution process, we were able to complete the
        assignment with time to spare, each member gaining a
        high grade in the process.

    <p>Numerical Ability</p>
    <p>
        Throughout my education I have always had a
        fascination with mathematics, which influenced me to
        choose fractal generation as the base of my final year
        university project. This required the use of multiple
        high level mathematical techniques and formulas to
        correctly generate the fractal pattern to be shown in
        the final program. I had very little experience with
        generating fractals before this project so had to
        research the relevant topics relating to the specific
        fractals I wanted to generate, this involved learning
        about advanced mathematical elements such as complex and
        imaginary numbers and correctly transferring that
        knowledge into my program. I successfully implemented
        three fractal sets in the final version of my project,
        each being refined and mathematically stable, and went
        on to use my gained knowledge to present and explain my
        project to a small marking group.
