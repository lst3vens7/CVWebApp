    <h4>2021 - 2022 | Computing Researcher, University of Huddersfield</h4>
    <p>
        A 12-month full-time research position completed as the year in industry component
        of my degree. It involved working closely with a small team of lecturers and PHD students
        to design and create a mobile application aimed at helping students with their mental health.
        Throughout my time in the position, I gained valuable experience in researching and planning a
        large-scale project, while self-teaching Android Studio and React Native for development of the
        product, also gaining an insight into the workings of a large company and the processes it has
        for distribution of resources and hiring new talent.

    <h4>2019 | Volunteering | Beckfoot School and Various Convention Venues</h4>
    <p>
        Previous volunteering experience and gained the VInspired V30 award in This involved
        supporting younger children with their reading skills, through regular contact to help
        the development of their reading skills while also helping my communication, organisational
        and time management skills. Another semi-regular volunteering role was assisting at various
        Comic-Con type events which involved helping to set up the event and supporting it
        throughout the days it was active. This was a very public facing role, which required me
        to be proactive and confident when dealing with large crowds of people, and to follow a
        strict timetable for both me, the team, and the guests I was responsible for.
